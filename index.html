    <p>General Mills introduced Trix in 1954 as a sugar-coated version of its popular cereal, Kix.[1][2] The original Trix cereal was composed of more than 46% sugar.[citation needed] The original cereal included three colors: "Orangey Orange" (formerly named Orange Orange), "Lemony Yellow" (formerly named Lemon Yellow), and "Raspberry Red". Five fruit shapes and colors were added over the years: "Grapity (or Grapey) Purple", (1984), "Lime Green" (1991), "Wildberry Blue" (1996â€“2007), and "Watermelon" (1998). In 1991 and again in 1995, the cereal pieces were given a brighter, more colorful look. General Mills' Yoplait division produces a Trix-branded yogurt marketed to children with sweetened fruit flavors such as "Watermelon Burst".[3] Later, Trix Swirls were introduced, with flavors such as "Rasp-orangey orange swirl" (a mix of the Orangey orange and Raspberry red flavors). A new flavor, "Wildberry Red Swirl", was introduced in 2011. Trix Swirls have since been discontinued; and the pieces in the original Trix were changed to their original 2007 flavor and shape lineup in 2014.</p>
    <p>The cereal originally used spherical cereal pieces, but in 1991, these were changed to puffed fruit-shaped pieces, presumably to avoid clashing with Berry Berry Kix upon the latter's 1992 introduction. In 2007, they reverted to their original shape in the United States. However, they maintained the fruit-shaped pieces in Mexico.</p>
    <p>In 2015, General Mills announced it would no longer use artificial colors in its cereals, and that Trix would be among the first to change. Trix would go from six colors to four because satisfactory natural alternatives were found for orange, yellow, red, and purple but not blue or green.[4]</p>
    <p>On September 21, 2017 General Mills announced that the six color version of Trix cereal would be reintroduced back to the market and that artificial dyes and flavors would be utilized to do so. The four color, non-artificial dye/flavor version would continue to be sold.[5] In the same announcement General Mills stated that they are planning to re-revert the spherical shapes back to the puffed fruit-shaped pieces.</p>
